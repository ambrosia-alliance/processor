2. **app/database/db.py** - Database manager with CRUD operations

## Files Modified

1. **app/config.py** - Added training hyperparameters, focal loss settings, database path
2. **app/pipeline/classifier.py** - Added fine-tuned model loading with fallback to zero-shot
3. **main.py** - Updated to pass finetuned_model_path to classifier
4. **requirements.txt** - Added scikit-learn
5. **README.md** - Added fine-tuning information and quick start guide

## Key Features

### 1. Focal Loss for False Positive Reduction

```python
focal_loss_alpha = 0.75
focal_loss_gamma = 2.0
```

- Alpha of 0.75 means false positives are penalized more than false negatives
- Gamma of 2.0 focuses learning on hard-to-classify examples
- Optional per-category class weights for further fine-tuning

### 2. Human-in-the-Loop Labeling

- Interactive CLI with keyboard shortcuts (y/n/s/u/q)
- Shows model predictions to guide labeling
- Immediate save after each sample
- Undo last sample capability
- Progress tracking with statistics

### 3. SQLite Database

- Persistent storage for all labels
- Sample tracking with labeled/unlabeled status
- Training run history with metrics
- Efficient indexing for fast queries

### 4. Fine-Tuning Pipeline

- Freezes BART encoder initially, trains classification head
- 80/20 train/validation split
- Early stopping with patience
- Per-category metrics (F1, precision, recall)
- Model checkpointing

### 5. Seamless Model Switching

The classifier automatically:
- Loads fine-tuned model if path is configured and exists
- Falls back to zero-shot if model not found
- Uses same interface for both modes

## Workflow

```
Text File → Sample Collector → SQLite Database
                                    ↓
User Labels Samples ← CLI Labeler ←
                                    ↓
                            Training Dataset
                                    ↓
                            Fine-tuning Trainer
                                    ↓
                            Saved Model
                                    ↓
                            Classifier (Production)
```

## Dataset Size Recommendations

- **Minimum viable**: 50-100 samples per category (~500-1000 total)
- **Good performance**: 200-500 samples per category (~1500-3000 total)
- **Production-ready**: 500-1000+ samples per category

With multi-label classification (13 categories), starting with 500-1000 total samples is reasonable.

## Usage Examples

### Label Data
```bash
python label.py sample_data.txt
```

### Train Model
```bash
python train.py
```

### Use Fine-Tuned Model
```python
settings.finetuned_model_path = "models/finetuned/model_20250118_143022"
python main.py
```

## Technical Decisions

1. **SQLite over CSV**: Better for concurrent access, relationships, and querying
2. **CLI over Web UI**: Faster to implement, keyboard shortcuts for speed
3. **Random sampling**: Simple and effective for initial data collection
4. **BART-large-mnli**: Already proven for zero-shot, good starting point for fine-tuning
5. **Focal loss**: Specifically designed to handle class imbalance and reduce false positives

## False Positive vs False Negative Handling

The system addresses your concern about false positives being worse than false negatives through:

1. **Focal loss alpha=0.75**: Weights positive class errors more heavily
2. **Per-category class weights**: Can further penalize specific categories
3. **Confidence threshold tuning**: Can be raised to reduce false positives
4. **Precision-focused metrics**: Training monitors precision alongside F1

You can adjust the trade-off by:
- Increasing `focal_loss_alpha` (more FP penalty)
- Increasing `confidence_threshold` (fewer positive predictions)
- Setting higher class weights for critical categories

## Next Steps

1. Collect and label samples using `label.py`
2. Train initial model after ~500 samples
3. Evaluate per-category metrics
4. Iterate: focus on weak categories, collect more data
5. Adjust hyperparameters based on results
6. Deploy fine-tuned model to production

## Performance Expectations

With proper labeling:
- **Precision improvement**: 10-30% over zero-shot
- **Recall improvement**: 15-40% over zero-shot
- **Inference speed**: 2-5x faster than zero-shot
- **False positive reduction**: 20-50% with focal loss

Actual results depend on data quality and quantity.
